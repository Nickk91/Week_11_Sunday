// Node.js Server-Side:

// Access to File System: Node.js has the ability to interact with the file system on the server, allowing it to read and write files. This is a server-side capability that is not available in the client-side JavaScript running in the browser.

// Network Communication: Node.js enables server-side JavaScript to perform network operations, such as making HTTP requests, creating web servers, and handling network protocols. These capabilities are not present in client-side JavaScript within the browser.

// Operating System Interaction: Node.js can interact with the underlying operating system, allowing it to execute system commands, spawn child processes, and perform other tasks that are not possible on the client side.

// Client-Side JavaScript:

// DOM Manipulation: Client-side JavaScript has direct access to the Document Object Model (DOM) of a web page, allowing it to dynamically manipulate the content, structure, and style of the page. This capability is not available to Node.js running on the server.

// User Interface Interaction: Client-side JavaScript is responsible for handling user interactions and events within the browser, providing a dynamic and responsive user interface. This includes actions like button clicks, form submissions, and mouse movements.

// Browser-Specific APIs: Client-side JavaScript has access to browser-specific APIs, such as the Web Audio API, WebRTC, and Canvas API, which enable features like audio processing, real-time communication, and graphics rendering. These APIs are not available in Node.js on the server side.
